            The Restly platform is built around the goal of providing travelers
            with exceptional, budget-friendly accommodation options across the
            globe. It connects hosts and guests, offering more than just a place
            to stayâ€”it&apos;s about creating memorable travel experiences.
            Whether travelers are looking for urban apartments or remote cabins
            in the mountains, Restly offers something to suit every journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the app, both registered members and guests can explore a
            global selection of available accommodations. The homepage displays
            properties ready for rent, and users can refine their search through
            filters and an interactive map highlighting the listings. If a user
            finds a property of interest but isn&apos;t ready to book, they can
            &quot;like&quot; it to save for future consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Property owners can showcase their vacation homes using a dedicated
            listing tool. They must include a title, photos, and a description
            of the amenities. Each listing provides a detailed overview with
            images to help guests visualize the property. An integral part of
            the listing is a booking calendar with customizable pricing,
            allowing guests to book stays for up to two weeks. Payments are
            processed securely through an external provider (Stripe), ensuring
            seamless transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hosts communicate with guests through a text-based messaging system,
            ensuring that all necessary details are provided. After their stay,
            guests are encouraged to leave reviews and ratings. If a review
            contains problematic content, it can be flagged, prompting an
            administrator to assess whether it violates the platform&apos;s
            guidelines.
